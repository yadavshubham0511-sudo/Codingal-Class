<h1>introduction of scientist in field of science</h1>
<p>Scientist are curious explorers who use systematic methods,
observation,and experiments to unraval the mysteries of universe feom the
 smallest particles to vast galaxies,driven by a restless quest for knowledge 
 to understand how the world works and improve human life.They work in diverse field like
 biology,chemistery,zoology,physics,space exploration and more,forming a global community
 deticated to testing theories,anylazing data,andsharing discoveriesthat push the boundries of human understanding.

They ask question and seek answers about the natural world.T hey use evidence,fomulate hypothleses,and conduct
experiments to validate them.they range from astronomrs studying stars 
tobiologists studying life,working in labs,universities or regulatory bodies.
They notice phenomenon and wonder "why" and "how".They desing studies,collect data andtest ideas
.They use science to create new technologies,from A.P.J Abdul kalam's work in missieles,
or C.V.Ramana's discovery of the Raman effect.They develop new understanding.

<h2><U>C.V.Raman:</U></h2>
<p> Sir Chandrashekhar Venkata Raman (C.V.Raman) was an Indian Physicist,the first the nobke prize
in physics,1930,renowned for discovering the<b>THE RAMAN EFFECT</b>,where light changes wavelength
after scattering off materials,a phenomenon forming the basis of <b><u> RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY</u></b>,used in material anylaysis.
</p>
<h4><U>Early life</U>: Chandrashekhar Venkata Raman was born at Tiruchirpalli in Tamil Nadu on 7th november 1888 to a physiscs teacher.
Raman was very sharp student.After doing his matriculation at 12,he was supposed to go abroad for higher studies,but after medical examination
,a British surgeon suggested against it.Rama attend Presidency College,MADRAS.A fter complettinghis graduation in 1904,and M.Sc. in physics in 1907,
Raman put through various significanct resesarches in the field of physics.He studied the diffraction of light and his thiesis on the subject was published in 1906.
</h4>
<h4><u>Contribution and Achievements: </u>On a sea voyage to Europe in 1921,Raman curioulsy noticed the blue
color of the glacier and the  Mediterranean.He was passionate to discover the reson of the blue color.Once Raman returned o  India, he performed
many experiments regarding to the scattering of light from water and transporent blocks of ice.According to the results,he establishedthe scientific explaination
for the blue color of sea-water and sky.</h4>
